# NodeSchoolSP

On November 2nd I went to the NodeSchoolSP, where a group of developers were able to access the Workshop Open Source built on Node and do the exercises to learn the basics of: 

* variables;
*strings; 
*numbers;
*for loop;
*arrays; 
*object properties, and so on. 

There were mentors to assist whenever needed and the group could help each other in case of doubt. 

As a JavaScript learner I (as well as those participants)  intend as much as I can to be with other people who not only know more but also have some tips and feedback about my/our progress. 

This is the community strength. =)
